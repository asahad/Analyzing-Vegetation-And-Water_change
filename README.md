# Brumadinho - 2019 Dam Failure NDVI and NDWI Time-series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the environmental impact of the Brumadinho dam failure in 2019 using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The analysis focuses on changes in vegetation and water bodies using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).

## Key Features
- **Data Processing:** Efficient handling and processing of Sentinel-2 imagery using Python libraries such as `geopandas`, `rasterio`, `matplotlib`, and `osmnx`.
- **NDVI and NDWI Calculation:** Methods to calculate NDVI and NDWI from the satellite imagery.
- **Visualization:** Functions to visualize the processed data and create animations to demonstrate temporal changes.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to ensure smooth execution.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer.
- The following Python libraries installed:
  - `geopandas`
  - `rasterio`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `imageio`
  - `osmnx`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install geopandas rasterio matplotlib imageio osmnx

The data analysis is in the Jupyter notebook named ndvi_timeseries
